    \section{Most undersupplied hours}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    
    As an indicator of most undersupplied hours,
    it makes sense to take
    the hours where
    most people did not see an available car
    in the app,
    as found in the \emph{demand data} table.
    %
    Weekly averages look as follows:

    \end{center}
    
    The peaks are (in order of decreasing undersuppy):

    \section{24h curve of average supply and demand}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    By ``supply'' we mean number of people who saw a car
    and by ``demand'' we mean also those that did not,
    as found in the \emph{demand data} table.

    Estimate extra hours needed 
    \begin{align}
        \text{online hours} \times
        \frac{\text{people saw no car}}{\text{people saw a car}}
        .
    \end{align}
